# RabbitMQ Producer-Consumer Example with FastAPI

ðŸš€ A simple implementation of the Producer-Consumer pattern using RabbitMQ and FastAPI.

This repository demonstrates how to build asynchronous communication between services using RabbitMQ message queues.

---

## ðŸ”§ Technologies

- **FastAPI**: A modern, fast web framework for building APIs with Python.
- **RabbitMQ**: A robust message broker for asynchronous communication.
- **aio-pika**: An asynchronous library for interacting with RabbitMQ.

---

## ðŸ“œ Features

### Producer:
- Sends messages to a RabbitMQ queue.
- Supports custom data submission through an API.

### Consumer:
- Processes messages from a RabbitMQ queue.
- Demonstrates asynchronous data handling.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

- `producer/` â€” Producer implementation that sends data to RabbitMQ.
- `consumer/` â€” Consumer implementation that reads and processes messages.
- `docker-compose.yml` â€” A quick setup for RabbitMQ using Docker.
- `README.md` â€” Detailed project documentation with usage examples.

## ðŸš€ How to Run?

1. Make sure Docker and Docker Compose are installed.
2. Start RabbitMQ via Docker:
   
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
